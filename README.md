Wild Arms 5 Tinkering/small mods and things

A program written in C and compiled for Linux, there are a few files but for the moving box one compile and run the "controller_write.c" file the other files are for debugging and also listning your devices you have connected to your computer if you want to add other then a Playstation 4 controller.

As of now you can press a button on your Playstation 4 controller (joystick and D-Pads are disbaled as they are bugged) that reads the games data from RAM using PCSX2Emulator of a movable box and then adds + 10 to its Y coordinates and by writing it in to the games RAM.

The Goal is to be able to use the D-Pad to move the box without the need to have the player stend next to it and also to beable so that you dont have to push it from side to side but to move it freely up and down also.

I will add things as i find more things in the game, this is a hoby for me and i dont rush things and i have not played this gabe before i just thout it woud be fun to play around in the gamnes data with the box.
